			<b>Description</b><br />	    	

	    	With every click you make, the system highlights its location with a red circle. <br />
	    	After three clicks are made, the system draws a parallelogram with those clicks as three of its corners
	    	and a circle with the same area and center of mass as the parallelogram. <br />
	    	At any time, you can drag any of the click-circles and, as you move it around, the figures will be updated accordingly.
	    	<br /><br />

	    	<b>How does it work?</b></br>

	    	After we've drawn the parallelogram we have to get its area, which can be gotten applying the following formula: <br />

	    	So, now we have two unknown variables - <b>h</b> and <b>B</b> - 

	    	<img src="graphic.png" height="200"><br />	    	

	    	To find <b>h</b> we have to apply the formula of the minimum distance between a dot and a line: <br />

	    	And to find <b>B</b> we apply pitagoras, being B the hipotenuse of the triangle.

	    	After we've calculated the area, the only thing that's left to find is the <b>radius</b> of the circle we want to draw. 
	    	We can deduce it by applying the formula of the area of a triangle. <br />
